Kitodo. Digital Library Modules
------------------------------

[Kitodo](https://github.com/kitodo) is an open source software suite intended to support mass digitization projects for cultural heritage institutions. Kitodo is widely-used and cooperatively maintained by major German libraries and digitization service providers. The software implements international standards such as METS, MODS and other formats maintained by the Library of Congress. Kitodo consists of several independent modules serving different purposes such as controlling the digitization workflow, enriching descriptive and structural metadata, and presenting the results to the public in a modern and convenient way.
